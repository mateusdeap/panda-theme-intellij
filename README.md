# Panda Theme for IntelliJ Platform v0.0.1

My own version of the Panda Theme for IntelliJ based products.

There's not much to it. I love the panda theme in VS Code and I wanted to have it in RubyMine and Android Studio. It is very much an ongoing project (hence the 0.0.1 version). I've only gotten so far as to set up a few colors the way I think seems appropriate, but they probably will be changed, I merely tried to stick to how VS Code did things since I don't know much about UX or UI, so any suggestions are apreciated.

# Installation

For now, being pretty incipient, I'll not publish this plugin anywhere. To install just follow these steps:
  1. Download the panda_theme.jar file in the root directory.
  2. Open your JetBrains IDE of choice and go to the Settings > Plugins
  3. Click the cog icon and choose the 'Install Plugin from Disk...' option.
  4. Navigate to where you downloaded the .jar file and select it
  5. Restart the IDE and choose the theme frome the Theme dropdown menu in Settings > Appearance.
  6. Bob's your uncle. Or not, since you may not like it =(
