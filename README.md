# Panda Theme for IntelliJ Platform v0.0.1

My own version of the Panda Theme for IntelliJ based products.

There's not much to it. I love the panda theme in VS Code and I wanted to have it in RubyMine and Android Studio.
It is very much an ongoing project (hence the 0.0.1 version). This uses the xml file provided in
https://github.com/PandaTheme/panda-syntax-intellij. I merely put it in a plugin structure and added some colors
to some IDE elements, but only a very few so suggestions and ideas are definitely welcome.

# Installation

For now, being pretty incipient, I'll not publish this plugin anywhere. To install just follow these steps:
  1. Download the panda_theme.jar file in the root directory.
  2. Open your JetBrains IDE of choice and go to the Settings > Plugins
  3. Click the cog icon and choose the 'Install Plugin from Disk...' option.
  4. Navigate to where you downloaded the .jar file and select it
  5. Restart the IDE and choose the theme frome the Theme dropdown menu in Settings > Appearance.
  6. Bob's your uncle. Or not, since you may not like it =(
